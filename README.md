# Introduction to HSC12 assembler programming


As part of study laboratory we created some basic assambler functions as an introduction for HCS12 programming.
The goal was to learn the architecture, programming & debugging of embedded systems, and laying the ground-work for later labs.
Some of the implemented functions will be used later in a clock with a DCF77 radio-freuquency interface, receiving the current date and time information via antenna.
Implemented:
* delay_0_5sec
* initLED
* setLED
* getLED
* toggleLED
* hexToASCII
* decToASCII
